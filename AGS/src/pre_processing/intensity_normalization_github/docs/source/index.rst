intensity-normalization documentation
===================================================

This package contains various routines to normalize the intensity of various contrasts of magnetic resonance (MR) brain images; specifically,
T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w), and FLuid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR). Intensity normalization is an important pre-processing step
in many image processing applications regarding MR images since MR images do not have a consistent intensity scale.
